Like many people, I am forced to use Slack on a daily basis. I noticed
a lot of opportunities for simple improvements in the interface, so I have
implemented them here.

The first goal of open sourcing this and publishing [the extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/bcepjjjdnkimgfmchbjlglhgbcelfoaa) is so
that others can also enjoy these improvements and contribute to further
improvements. Both [Refined
GitHub](https://github.com/sindresorhus/refined-github) and [Refined
Twitter](https://github.com/sindresorhus/refined-twitter) are currently
doing a great job of this.

The second goal is that Slack will notice and implement some of these much
needed improvements to their product. If you like any of these changes,
please let Slack know!

I'd like to thank Sindre Sorhus and all of the other contributors to

primary inspiration for my work here.
